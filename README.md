# Credit-Risk-Modelling
•	Developed a credit risk model in Python, estimating Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD) using logistic and linear regression.
•	Implemented a comprehensive credit scoring system, leveraging parameters such as annual income, credit delinquency, employment length, home ownership status, and additional borrower data.
•	Explored model accuracy and reliability through confusion matrix analysis and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve evaluation.
•	Used Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and Seaborn for data handling, statistical analysis, visualization, and model building.
•	Modeled LGD and EAD with additional validations for predictive accuracy.
•	Calculated expected loss for each borrower to support risk assessment and financial decision-making.
